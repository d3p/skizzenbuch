# floating.numbers

floating.numbers is a 9-metre long interactive table with a mass of numbers flowing in a continuum on its surface. Individual digits appear randomly at the surface of this stream of numbers and, once touched by a visitor, surrender their secret in text, pictures, films and animation.
The significance of the numbers materialises from the various perspectives of science, religion, art or one’s outlook on everyday life.
a more complete project description is available at the art+com website including a video documentation of the final projekt.

## SKETCHES

### SimpleSpring

this sketch illustrates the behavior of the numbers when they reach the surface.

### SimpleVehiclePulse

a sketch for the movement of the numbers on the surface.

### FlowpathGenerator

a tool to author the shape of the stream of numbers.

### TextExplosion

this sketch illustrates the behavior of the text once a digit is touched.

### SimpleVehicleFlow

this sketch illustrates the different states of a number. floating in the stream, surfacing, lingering on the surface, diving.

### SimpleTail

in this sketch we explored the construction of a multi-digit number, using an angle-constrain concept.

### SimpleTrails

this sketches created trails that emphasize the difference between floating under the surface and being on the surface. numbers on the surface generate trails whereas numbers floating under the surface don t.

### CubeWorldTransformed

this sketches addresses an issue that arises when you look into a box with a perspective distortion; the bottom always appears smaller than the top of the box. while we wanted this distortion for the numbers, we couldn t use it when handling visual edges hence we pre-distorted the space.
this sketch also illustrates the technique of slicing a finite space into blocks to optimize proximity sensing. it is much faster to just look for neighbors in a handfull of blocks and just ignore the rest, then to look at every single entity in the application.
